Porcelain
=========

## Prerequisites

Porcelain requires [goon](https://github.com/alco/goon) to work. The binary for OS X is included, put it in your application's working directory or somewhere in your `$PATH`.

## Usage

Coming soon. See the [tests](https://github.com/alco/porc/blob/master/test/porc_test.exs) for usage examples.
